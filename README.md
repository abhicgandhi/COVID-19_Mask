# COVID-19_Mask
Hypothesis: Masks have been an extremely controversial topic during the pandemic. Though a majority of people agree they are beneficial, there are a few who disagree with the effectiveness of masks. I want to see if masks are associated with a positive sentiment or negative sentiment. If they are associated with a positive sentiment, it means it is likely to be a beneficial piece of equipment and it should be worn when people are interacting with each other. If there is a negative sentiment it shows that it may potentially not be helpful. I am also interested to see the sentiment before COVID-19 and during COVID-19. As these are research articles, my hypothesis would be masks are beneficial and the sentiment is very similar.
